Grid #1
-------

The figure below shows the grid point alignments made by the GridGen code with algebraic grid and uniform grid spacing assumptions at every boundary edges. The interior points were generated by applying linear interpolation based two opposed pre-specified grid points. Thus the current grid has almost straight lines but with normally inclined angles, which makes a little skewed cells in the leading edge of the air foil. Also we can find a sudden change in cell volume across two grid lines anchored in leading and trailing edges of the airfoil.

The more quantitative analysis is available with grid Jacobian contour on the current mesh. The 'Jacobian' here is inherently defined as determinant of inverse grid Jacobian matrix at every single grid point. Thus, it indicates a grid cell volume in 3D and cell area in 2D. Here, since the currently used Jacobian is defined at 3-dimensional coordinates, the grid shown below was made with a width of 0.1 m in :math:`y` direction , however, it does not have grid resolution in this direction.
